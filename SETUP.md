# Setup (about 15 minutes, once)

Three parts: put the app on GitHub Pages, connect a private Google Sheet, open it on both phones.

## 1. Put the app online (GitHub Pages)

Already done: the app lives in the `tusov-home/Budgeting` repository and is online at
**https://tusov-home.github.io/Budgeting/**. The steps below are for setting it up from scratch.

1. On github.com, create a new repository, e.g. `Budgeting` in the `tusov-home` organisation (public is fine: it contains no data and no keys).
2. Upload the contents of this folder (everything except `tests/screenshots`). The folder `apps-script` can go up too; it holds no secrets.
3. Repository **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment**: Source *Deploy from a branch*, branch `main`, folder `/ (root)`. Save.
4. After a minute the app is at `https://<owner>.github.io/<repository>/`, here `https://tusov-home.github.io/Budgeting/`.

## 2. Create the private Google Sheet and its sync script

1. In Google Drive (your account), create a new empty Google Sheet, e.g. "Household Budget data". Don't share it with anyone; the app talks to it through the script.
2. In the Sheet: **Extensions → Apps Script**. Delete the sample code, paste all of `apps-script/Code.gs`, and save (`Ctrl+S`).
3. Create the sync key: in the function list at the top choose **createKey**, click **Run**. Google asks for permission the first time (it's your own script: *Advanced → Go to … (unsafe) → Allow*). Open **Execution log**: it prints the key. Copy it somewhere safe (a password manager is ideal).
4. **Deploy → New deployment** → gear icon → **Web app**:
   - Description: `Household Budget sync`
   - Execute as: **Me**
   - Who has access: **Anyone**

   Click **Deploy** and copy the **Web app URL** (ends in `/exec`).

   *"Anyone" means anyone can reach the URL, but every request without the right key is refused, and opening the URL in a browser shows no data.*

## 3. Connect both phones

On each phone (Chrome on Android):

1. Open https://tusov-home.github.io/Budgeting/ .
2. **Settings → This phone belongs to**: pick your name.
3. **Sync with Google Sheet**: paste the Web app URL and the sync key → **Test and save**.
4. Chrome menu → **Install app** (use Chrome, not another browser: only an installed app can receive shared Revolut statements).

The top-right chip shows "Synced 08:12" when all is well.

## Moving to a new address

The browser keeps the app's data per address. After the move from `ttusov-art.github.io/Budgeting`
to `tusov-home.github.io/Budgeting`, each phone starts empty at the new address:

1. Uninstall the old Budget app from the phone (the old address now shows a 404 page).
2. Open the new address in Chrome, then **Settings → This phone belongs to** and **Sync with Google Sheet**
   (same Web app URL and sync key). Everything synced comes back from the Sheet.
3. Chrome menu → **Install app**.
4. Phone-only data does not move: unsorted imported purchases, the per-shop suggestions, and phone settings
   (e.g. vibration). Import the latest Revolut statement again; suggestions build up again as you sort.

## Later: changing the script

If `Code.gs` changes in a future version: paste the new code, then **Deploy → Manage deployments → edit (pencil) → Version: New version → Deploy**. The URL stays the same.

## If something goes wrong

- **"Wrong sync key"**: the key on the phone doesn't match the one in the script (Apps Script → Project Settings → Script properties → `APP_KEY`).
- **"APP_KEY is not set up"**: run `createKey` once (step 2.3).
- **HTTP 401/403 or a Google login page**: the deployment's access is not "Anyone"; edit the deployment.
