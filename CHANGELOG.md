# Changelog

## 2026-10-31 zi
- Check in balance first asks whether the latest purchases are sorted (and says how many are waiting). No → Purchases; Yes → enter the Revolut balance.

## 2026-10-31 zh
- Purchases: Import CSV is a green main button.

## 2026-10-31 zg
- Import results stay on screen until you tap OK. Other messages stay longer when they are longer.

## 2026-10-31 zf
- Open Revolut now opens the Revolut app directly (via revolut.com/app, which the app catches) instead of the Play Store.

## 2026-10-31 ze
- Purchases: on the phone, Import CSV asks: Open Revolut (with the three export steps) or Choose file. On a computer it still opens the file picker straight away.

## 2026-10-31 zd
- Purchases help: Revolut → Generate → open with Sheets → Share → Budget (confirmed on Android). Note that the app must be installed from Chrome to appear in the share list.

## 2026-10-31 zc
- Purchases help: back to the Sheets route for Revolut statements. Revolut only offers "Open with", and Chrome on Android doesn't list web apps there yet; sharing to Budget still works from apps that offer Share.

## 2026-10-31 zb
- Purchases: the month is shown at the top again. Importing a statement takes only the chosen month's purchases; the others are named in the message, with a button to import that month too. "Also to sort: 1 in October" points to purchases waiting in another month.
- Pending card payments (no balance yet in the custom statement) are left out and picked up by a later import once they go through, under the date they were paid.
- Adding a purchase by hand while looking at an earlier month suggests that month's last day.

## 2026-10-31 za
- Revolut statements can be sent straight to the app: after Generate, pick Budget in Android's Share / Open with list, and the purchases are imported on the Purchases screen (share target + file handler). No Google Sheets or saving step needed. The file stays on the phone.

## 2026-10-31 z
- Purchases: "How to export from Revolut" now describes the quicker route from the home screen (… More → Statement → Custom → CSV).

## 2026-10-31 y
- Wallet: the bar's marker is now labelled "expected by today" (was "plan for today"), and the pace message reads "… % of the expected pace".
- "+ Add money" stays on the same line as the pace message in the bottom-right corner of Budget left; the message wraps instead.

## 2026-10-31 x
- Form buttons (Cancel/Save) are pinned to the bottom of the form, so they stay visible above the keyboard; tighter spacing in forms on phones.

## 2026-10-31 w
- On-screen keyboard no longer hides the form you're filling in: the app area shrinks when the keyboard opens (interactive-widget=resizes-content), forms sit at the top on phones, never get taller than the visible area (they scroll inside), and the focused field is kept in view.

## 2026-10-31 v
- Purchases: panels in step order (1. To sort, 2. To withdraw). When everything is sorted it shows when you last sorted.
- Reminder when the last full sort is more than 7 days ago: note on Purchases, "!" on the tab, note on Wallet. An import with nothing new counts as sorted.
- Swiping between screens now works anywhere on the screen, also on empty space below short pages (e.g. Big costs).

## 2026-10-31 u
- Wallet: "Check in balance" is the one main button; "+ Add money" is a quiet link in the lower right of the Budget left panel.
- Progress bar thinner with a calmer green; the "plan for today" marker is a soft grey line. Orange/red stay strong when over plan.

## 2026-10-31 t
- Sync status moved out of the header (too close to the month arrows) into the Wallet panel, merged with the version: "● Synced 16:17 · v31.10 t". Tap to sync.
- Other screens show an orange line under the header only when sync fails or changes wait offline.

## 2026-10-31 s
- Screens follow the monthly routine: Month → Wallet → Purchases → Big costs → Settings (tabs, swiping, keys 1–5).
- Opening the app starts on Month until the current month is locked, then on Wallet.

## 2026-10-31 r
- One corner style everywhere: rectangles with slightly rounded corners (panels 12 px, buttons/inputs/chips 10 px, tags 6 px). No more pill or circle buttons. Set once as tokens at the top of css/style.css.

## 2026-10-31 q
- Locking needs both: the month locks when both have approved the same numbers, and unlocks only when both agree. Each phone votes for its owner (Settings → This phone belongs to).
- An approval is tied to the numbers: changing salaries, wallet budget, carry-over, fixed costs or big-cost shares after approving asks for approval again.

## 2026-10-31 p
- Purchases: new "Personal & already settled" list (collapsed) with "Back" per purchase and "Put all back", to fix wrong choices.

## 2026-10-31 o
- Purchases: "Already settled before…" clears unsorted purchases up to a date (e.g. ones balanced out before using the app) without counting them as common or personal and without teaching the shop memory. Undo available.

## 2026-10-31 n
- Fix: Revolut statements with garbled characters ("-â¬33.94" instead of "-€33.94") imported 0 purchases. Garbled text is now repaired (also umlauts in shop names), and amounts are read even with stray symbols.
- When nothing is imported, the message says why (incoming only, exchanges, unreadable amounts).

## 2026-10-31 m
- Pop-up messages: app colours (no white box), slightly rounded rectangle, long text wraps.
- Revolut import reads the app's "Custom statement" CSV: finds the transaction list after the introduction, handles several account sections, month-name dates and amounts with currency signs.
- Only the EUR account is imported; payments in other currencies (e.g. SEK) are reported as left out.
- Duplicate check uses normalised values, so the same purchase is recognised across export formats; identical purchases on one day are kept apart.
- Revolut's category is shown under each purchase to sort.

## 2026-10-31 l
- New **Purchases** screen for the weekly routine: import the Revolut statement (CSV), sort each purchase into common or personal, then record the withdrawal from the shared pocket.
- The app remembers per shop what you chose and suggests it next time ("Accept suggestions").
- Already-imported transactions are skipped, so overlapping exports are fine.
- Common purchases count as wallet spending as soon as they are sorted; withdrawals in a later month don't count twice.
- Personal purchases and imported statements stay on the phone; only common purchases and withdrawals are shared.
- Manual "add common purchase" for cash. Badge on the tab shows how many purchases wait to be sorted.
- Tabs/shortcuts: 1 Wallet, 2 Purchases, 3 Month, 4 Big costs, 5 Settings; I = import.

## 2026-10-31 k
- Month screen order follows the monthly routine: fixed costs → this month's money → big costs → lock → transfers → summary.
- "Lock budget": once agreed, salaries, wallet budget, carry-over and the fixed-cost list become read-only and the big-cost shares are frozen. Ticking costs as paid and marking transfers still work. "Unlock" reopens it.
- Wallet shows a reminder while the month's budget isn't locked.

## 2026-10-31 j
- Month: tap a deposit box to mark the transfer as done ("To transfer" ↔ "✓ Transferred"); synced, one record per person.
- "Private money each" moved to the bottom of the transfers panel.

## 2026-10-31 i
- Swiping now gives visible feedback: the page follows your finger, slides out when switching, bounces back at the first/last screen, and glides back when the swipe was too short.

## 2026-10-31 h
- Swiping between screens is more sensitive (shorter, slower and more diagonal swipes count).

## 2026-10-31 g
- Swipe left/right to move between Wallet, Month, Big costs and Settings (phones).

## 2026-10-31 f
- Android status and navigation bars now match the app background (no bright green edges).
- Entry titles wrap instead of running under the amount.

## 2026-10-31 e
- Version shown at the top of the Wallet page.
- "Add purchase" removed: check-ins use the actual Revolut balance.
- New "Add money" (shortcut A): personal money put into the wallet. It raises the balance but is not counted as negative spending and does not raise the budget.
- Carry-over is automatic: a month starts with the previous month's last check-in balance (can be overridden on the Month screen).
- Budget vs. actual compares spending with the agreed wallet budget only.

## 2026-10-31 d
- Fix: "Reload" for a new version could bring back the old version on the laptop for up to 10 minutes (GitHub Pages caching). The service worker now has Chrome re-check every file, and Reload clears saved copies first.
- New test: tests/update.spec.py checks updates arrive through GitHub-like caching.

## 2026-10-31 c
- Check-ins now record the **balance left in the wallet**; spent = start balance − balance. A new check-in replaces the previous one instead of mixing totals.
- Month: optional "Left in the wallet from last month"; the summary shows what the wallet starts the month with.
- Older "spent so far" check-ins are still understood.

## 2026-10-31 b
- Salaries per month: the leftover of both salaries (after fixed costs, big costs and the wallet) is split evenly as private money; deposits follow from that.
- Each salary syncs as its own record, so both phones can enter theirs at the same time.
- "Copy last month" also copies the salaries.
- Fix: keyboard shortcuts were ignored right after closing a form with Esc.

## 2026-10-31 a — first version
- Month setup: wallet budget, fixed costs with payer and "paid" tick, copy from last month.
- Deposits for each person (half of the household total minus own payments).
- Wallet: weekly check-ins, single purchases, pace vs. plan, daily/weekly figures.
- Big costs: one-off purchases spread over months, recurring bills set aside monthly.
- Sync between phones through a private Google Sheet (Apps Script), works offline.
- Undo/redo, keyboard shortcuts, backup/restore, install to home screen, new-version banner.
